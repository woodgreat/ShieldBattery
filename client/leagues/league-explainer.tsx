            Find a league that is currently running or accepting signups in the format you'd like to
            play. Some leagues may have different requirements, rules, or qualifications, so make
            sure to read the information before joining!

          <div>
            Once a league has started, all ladder games you play will reward points towards the
            league standings alongside your normal ladder standings. Check the leaderboard on the
            league page to see how you're doing!

        </ListEntry>
        <ListEntry>
          <Emphasized>Win!</Emphasized>
          <div>
            After a league finishes, the leaderboard will be available for organizers to distribute
            prizes and rewards. Check out the league information page for more details.
