# Translation Guide

Translation in ShieldBattery is driven by volunteers! We recommend joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/g5mmNVfZzm) so that you can stay up-to-date with translation changes and easily ask questions.

## Basic Process

We've tried to make this process as easy as possible so that you can contribute even if you don't have technical expertise. There is some initial setup (instructions below), followed by an easier process to help out.

After you've gotten things set up, the basic process is:

1) Find unfinished strings or strings needing editing in a language of your choice
2) Figure out a good translation for the provided string and submit it as a suggestion
3) A ShieldBattery developer will accept or decline your suggestion. If there are issues with it, the developer will try to reach out over Discord to fix them.
4) The new translation will be pulled into the application, and make it into the next update. Congratulations, you've saved Brood War!

If that sounds good to you, please follow the steps below to get started:

## Dashboard Setup

First, go to our Weblate portal at https://translation.shieldbattery.net/projects/shieldbattery/app/

Create an account by clicking "Register" in the upper right corner. Once your account is created, log in. Then, enter your Settings menu, found here:

![Dashboard View](https://github.com/ShieldBattery/ShieldBattery/assets/93808824/b6cf3b66-f9d3-4d0b-b7db-732e5fac585e)

The first tab is the "Languages" tab, seen here: 

![Weblate Settings Languages Tab](https://github.com/ShieldBattery/ShieldBattery/assets/93808824/3b757bcb-5ab2-4e44-a5ca-37af9f57f4e9)

This tab is split into three sections:
- "Interface Language" changes the entire Weblate UI. If you want to read the entire website in a particular language, this is what you modify.
- "Translated Languages" contains all of the languages ShieldBattery is translated into. Click the ones you would like to help translate, which will move them from the "Available" column to the "Chosen" column.
- Any choices in "Secondary Languages" will show you translations of a given string in those languages during the translation process, which may be helpful for understanding context if you are able to translate for multiple languages.

Click "Save" when finished.

Next, switch to the "Notifications" tab, seen here:

![Weblate Settings Notifs Tab](https://github.com/ShieldBattery/ShieldBattery/assets/93808824/d684c26a-164a-4321-b2dc-da37396d1b5f)

Under "Watched Projects", select "ShieldBattery" to move it from the "Available" column to the "Chosen" column.

Click "Save" when finished.

Upon returning to the Dashboard, you should now see a full list of chosen languages (from "Translated Languages") in the "Watched Translations" tab. The more orange a bar is, the more translations are needed!

## Starting Out

At https://translation.shieldbattery.net/projects/shieldbattery/app/ you'll see a list of supported languages, along with their respective translation status. It looks like this:

![Main Weblate Screen](images/weblate-main-screen.png)

To begin, click on the pencil icon next to the language you want to translate (in the image above, a red background has been added for emphasis).

You will see a page that looks like this:

![Main Edit Menu](images/weblate-edit-menu.png)

Near the top, in the "Translation" box, is the source English text. On the right margin is the "Key" - the internal label of the string, which may contain some context clues about where the text will appear in the app (generally we follow a format of `feature.section.uniqueStringLabel`, so for this example, we can deduce from `games.results.headlineVictory` that the "Victory" text will appear as a headline on the game results screen). The target language is below (in this example, "Korean"). The text is automatically generated by machine translation and by default marked by a "Needs editing" checkbox - simply enter the translation and uncheck the box, then click "Save and continue" (if Editor role) or "Suggest". If the listed translation is already correct, uncheck the box without changing the text, then click "Save and continue" (if Editor role) or "Suggest".

If you are not sure about a translation, simply leave "Needs editing" checked so that another translator can make the final call. You can also discuss in the ‚Å†translations channel in the ShieldBattery discord. Weblate only imports strings once "Needs editing" is unchecked and an Editor has pressed "Save and continue".

Near the bottom of the image are the list of strings. Rows in red denote an `unfinished` string ("Needs editing" is checked), while rows in green denote a `translated` string.

## Tips

The best player experience will come from proper localization of strings, rather than direct translation. If your regional community calls it "1:1" instead of "1v1", that's exactly what they'll be looking for, and that's what we want to present.

You can use the filter bar near the top of the page to search for various statuses, as found here:

![Status Search](images/weblate-status-search.png)

Note that this only changes the filtered results at the top (the number on the left, "1 / 26" in the image), and not the list of strings below. You can navigate through the filtered results using the < and > buttons, and "Save and continue"/"Suggest" will always progress to the next filtered result.

(Editors only) Suggestions appear as a category filter above the list of strings, or in the "Strings with suggestions" filter at the top of the page. A suggestion looks like this:

![Suggestion Preview](images/weblate-suggestion-preview.png)

Editors can choose to Accept ( ‚úÖ), Accept and Edit (üìù), or Dismiss (üóëÔ∏è) suggestions. Although anyone can submit suggestions for translation, only logged-in Weblate accounts flagged as Editors by ShieldBattery administrators can directly update strings.

## Special Characters

Some strings will contain special characters, as seen here:

![Special Characters](https://github.com/ShieldBattery/ShieldBattery/assets/93808824/0979723a-06bc-446a-b3d6-9a1a8f73f964)

Text within `{{braces}}` should `never` be translated, as these contain code references which the app looks for. Text within `numeric tags` such as "<0><1>text</1></0>" `should` be translated, and can even be moved around within the string, but the ordering of the numeric tags must be preserved.
